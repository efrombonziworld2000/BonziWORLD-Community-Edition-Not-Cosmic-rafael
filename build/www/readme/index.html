            <h1 id="bonziworld">BonziWORLD Community Edition</h1>
            <h6 id="leading-the-industry-in-gorilla-based-chat-clients-">The BW fork made by the community, for the community. Leading the industry in literally any chat client. Made with the now defunct BonziWORLD Revived</h6>
            <h2 id="what-the-heck-is-this-">What the hell is this?</h2>
            <p>
                BonziWORLD is a node.js and socket.io based chat client featuring everyone&#39;s most <del>hated</del> loved purple gorilla. The client also uses speak.js to provide text-to-speech voices. It's not the exact BonziBUDDY voice, but Hey, it works.
            </p>
			<h2>Who made this?</h2>
			<p>
				BonziWORLD was originally created by heyjoeway, the site named "bonziworld.com" was shut down in July 2019 due to issues dealing with the users. He no longer wants to be involved with the community after he saw drama involving me and a minority hating dickhead.
				Please do not contact Joesph Judge as he doesn't want to be involved nor does he want to do anything in this community anymore.
				This version of BonziWORLD contains Quality of Life features including new colors involving Clippy and his friends, accurate voices, Themes, A logger (stolen from a mid server), more commands and some easter eggs.
				BonziWORLD Community Edition was originally created by Techy, the site named "bonziworld.co" was shut down in early 2024.
			</p>
			<h2>Does this contain malware?</h2>
			<p>
				No, of course not. However, User generated content on this site may have sketchy things, but we aren't responsible for that.
				All of the sketchy things such as the now deleted EvalJS Server Console, which was used to execute code in the server without having to use the server console, are not used anymore or have been removed. I am expecting bonzi.lol to make more fake news about this site containing "malware" and other horrible crap.
				So yeah, this site is perfectly safe to use. If anyone does manage to do some XSS exploits, let us know in the discord and we'll investigate.
			</p>
            <p>It also uses <a href="https://archive.org/download/WindowsXPCommercial/Windows%20XP%20Commercial.mp4" style="color: #000; text-decoration: none; cursor: default;">Windows XP</a> design as 'inspriation'. Also, A couple amount of people are working on this version of BonziWORLD based off an old project named BonziWORLD Revived, which eventually evolved into BonziWORLD Community Edition after 3 or 4 years of age.</p>
            <h2 id="why-did-you-make-this-why-would-you-make-this-">Why did you make this? Why WOULD you make this?</h2>
            <p>Memes. Also because I&#39;d already finished the BonziBUDDY portion of this project like a year in advance and was trying to find some way to put it to use. </p>
			<br>
			<h2>Wasn't this shut down many times before?</h2>
			<p>Yes. But in a month, i might change my mind and start hosting another server again. (Yeah, i know i've done this a thousand times. I honestly really like working on my BonziWORLD Projects. Many people seem to like it too. Every shutdowns of my servers are temporary. If this server is temporarily shut down, you know it's gonna come back in a month. If someone told me to shut it down and got caught in 4k, it's obviously gonna be brought back in a couple of moments. One example being Fune telling me to shut it down for 2 weeks and then plan to harass me and others in this server again, which immediately made me put it back up again.)</p>
			<h3>Promise me you won't be like bonzi.lol.</h3>
			<p>Boy, we are the real peaceful server. We are decent people, and we can have a nice talk with you, unless if we're in a bad mood. If you see a worthless midget harassing you, just mute them. M'kay?</p>

            <h2 id="are-there-any-rules-">Are there any rules?</h2>
            <p>Obviously no illegal shit. On top of that, there are a few limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All strings are sanitized to get rid of any malicious HTML/JS/CSS. <em>Don&#39;t even try it motherfucker.</em></li>
				<li>Anyone on the enemies list greater than Type 1 will be banned, or hypnotized. (Hypnotized = the user gets hijacked by a harmless JS injection code from Dr. Doof.)</li>
				<li>You may be punished for annoying others, being a cunt, or just posting bad content after all.</li>
                <li>
                    There is a 2500 character limit in public rooms and a 5000 limit in private rooms.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yes, the Navy Seals copypasta fits.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There is a 25 character limit on names.</li>
                <li>
                    A max of 8 people are allowed in a public lobby. After that, a new public room will be created. A max of 30 people are allowed in private lobbies.
                    <ul>
                        <li>(Yeah, I know I changed the limit down from 15. With the limited screen space and processing power on mobile, this was part of the reason things were running so shitty. However I have recently undone this change and made the server carry 15 users again.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Remember that people can play YouTube videos whenever they want. <strong>Keep your volume down, headphone users.</strong> Chat rooms are for the most part unmoderated. If shit starts getting chaotic, I might start using my
                banhammer. There are also some filters to prevent edge-tards from advertising their shock site, but it can be wonky. You might disconnect, or something might change.
